# Creating your Ads

Manage your Ads in the Craft control panel by clicking "Ad Wizard" in the sidebar.

<img :src="$withBase('/images/adwizard-new-ad.png')" class="dropshadow" alt="">

Before you can create any Ads, you will first need to create at least one Group. Every Ad you create will belong to a specific group. Once you've created your Ads, you'll then be able to embed them into your Twig templates.
